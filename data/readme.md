# Data 

The folder is used to store the full dataset, which was split into the training set, validation set and the test set. Due to confidentiality agreements with the internship company, the dataset cannot be shared with third parties. The file `example_dataset.csv` shows how the data is structured and provides one manually crafted example.

The annotated data contains client feedback from the governance domain in English. A detailed description of the data can be found in *Chapter 3 - Methodology* of the [Thesis](https://github.com/csenge-szabo/Multi-Label_Topic_Classification/blob/main/MA_Thesis_Csenge_Szabo.pdf). The first column is the unique identifier, the second column is the feedback statement and the remaining columns are dedicated for the 42 topic labels.
